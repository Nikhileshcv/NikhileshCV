Projects:
Vertex k-Labeling of Amalgamated Star Graphs using Algorithmic Approach
https://github.com/Nikhileshcv/homogenousamalgAmatedStar/blob/main/code.py
Developed an algorithm using branch and bound with brute force to solve the vertex k-labeling problem for
an amalgamated star graph, ensuring at most k labels for m inner and n outer vertices. The algorithm
maintains unique edge weights with a runtime of O(V+E).
Book Store Management System https://github.com/Nikhileshcv/SpringFullStackProject
Developed a book store management system enabling user sign-up, sign-in, and book operations (add, view,
delete) using Java Spring Framework, React.js, and MySQL. Deployed the system on AWS, leveraging
Amazon RDS, EC2, and S3 services
